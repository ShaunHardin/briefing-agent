## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11
- Gmail account
- Google Cloud project with Gmail API enabled

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShaunHardin/briefing-agent.git
cd briefing-agent
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
